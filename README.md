Weibo using AFNetworking

WeiboKit is highly influenced by the many Twitter Frameworks I have seen out there and [CheddarKit](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddarkit)

###Submodules currently Used

###License
WeiboKit is released under the [Simplified BSD License](https://github.com/PaulWoodIII/WieboKit/blob/master/LICENSE).

#WeiboKit is under active development!

Any help would be appreciated. Open an Issue or a Pull Request if you have something to share.
